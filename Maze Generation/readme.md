I found this website: http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/2/7/maze-generation-algorithm-recap
I then wanted to build a maze! :D

I decided to try the "Hunt-and-Kill algorithm" and wrote my own version of it.

Note: Change both delays into 0 and turn of the debugger to see how fast the algorithm is. Setting blockSize to 18 speeds it up as well.
