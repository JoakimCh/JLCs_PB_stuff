JLCs PB stuff
=============
This is just a place where I will try to share useful PureBasic code written or by me or other useful code I've modified.

Previously I only used the "Tricks 'n' Tips" section of the PureBasic forum for sharing my open source code, but this is a better place since other people can participate in keeping the code up to date and/or improove it.

Everything posted here is public domain and free to use.
