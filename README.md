JLCs PB stuff
=============
This is just a place where I will try to share useful PureBasic code written or by me or other useful code I've modified.

Previously I only used the "Tricks 'n' Tips" section of the PureBasic forum for sharing my open source code, but this is a better place since other people can participate in keeping the code up to date and/or improove it.

[All the code I've posted in the Tricks 'n' Tips forum since I got interested in the language](http://www.purebasic.fr/english/search.php?keywords=&terms=all&author=Joakim+Christiansen&fid%5B%5D=12&sc=1&sf=titleonly&sk=t&sd=d&sr=topics&st=0&ch=300&t=0&submit=Search)
